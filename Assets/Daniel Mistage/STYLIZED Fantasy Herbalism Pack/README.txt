Hi!

Thank you very much for purchasing the set.

When converting the set to URP or HDRP, you will need to remove the material "DOUBLE SIDED MATERIAL (Built-in)" as it will remain pink and will not convert naturally. To solve this problem, you should apply the "MAIN MATERIAL" to the assets that previously had the other material and enable the option to render both sides of the object.

If you encounter any problems, you can contact me at my email: danielmistage18@gmail.com
